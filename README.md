# StoopidSam

Hey there! My name's Sam, and I am the owner of The Editing Zone, which is a Discord community for video editors all around the world. 

## What I'm working on!

I am currently using GitHub to get help on the Discord bot that I am coding. It is a moderation bot that will eventually run The Editing Zone. I'm using Discord.py, which I have really enjoyed using so far. If you want to join The Editing Zone, you can do so here: https://discord.gg/Ca5Epax.

I am also currenlty working on a Discord bot called InsultoBot, which is a fun bot that insults members using randomly generated insults. It's a pretty basic bot at the moment, but I plan to add more features to it later on. You can invite the bot to your server here: https://tinyurl.com/InviteInsulto.

## Socials?

I have a very small YT channel called Sam's Stoopid Edits, which you can see here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbsDUy42u4gg0j3tE5fmXIw

If ya want to contact me on Discord, my username and tag is StoopidSam#0001 (flexing that sweet Nitro lol).
